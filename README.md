## MessTime App - Mess Meal Consumption Tracker

---

## Problem Statements

The aim of this project is to develop an efficient system for tracking a student's mess meal consumption, providing a digital solution that monitors a student's daily calorie intake and keeps a record of consumed meals across the entire campus.

## Proposed Solutions

The MessTime app targets two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as follows:

-   Good Health and Well-being (Goal 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
-   Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12): Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Our team has developed an app specifically designed for students to help them track their eating habits. The app sends push notifications to remind students of their daily calorie intake requirements and tracks their progress.

Many students tend to skip meals without considering the potential health issues they may face. This behavior also leads to food waste, as the mess committee needs an accurate count of meals consumed. Therefore, our app addresses Goal 3 by promoting healthy lifestyles among students and Goal 12 by encouraging sustainable consumption of food.

Using the MessTime app, students can mark their meals, and the app analyzes and reports the fulfillment of calorie requirements. This feature enables students to analyze their eating habits and plan their calorie intake accordingly.
